## Installation
Download the plugin and double-click to install.

## Usage
Once you have document colors set within your sketch file you can then use the shortcut `Cmd + Y` to apply first color in the document color palette to the existing fill of the shape object. By pressing the shortcut again you will proceed to the next color in the document colors. 

If the current color in the object is already in the document colors, the next color in line will be applied.
